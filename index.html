        <h3 id="what-they-are">What are salmon cookies?</h3>
        <p>Very good question! They're cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!) They are the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning. Or gray Seattle afternoon... whatever.</p>
